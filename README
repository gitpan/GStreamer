				   GStreamer
				  -----------

This module allows you to use version 0.10.x of the GStreamer C libraries from
Perl.  

NOTE: There is a separate Perl module for the 1.x series of the GStreamer C
libraries, available at https://metacpan.org/pod/GStreamer1.  The two C
libraries, as well as their associated Perl modules, can be installed
concurrently on the same host.

GStreamer 0.10.x comes with automatically generated API documentation.  Its
index can be accessed with:

  perldoc GStreamer::index

				 Installation

				 Dependencies
				--------------

GStreamer depends on any release of the 0.10 series of the GStreamer library
and on the following Perl modules:
