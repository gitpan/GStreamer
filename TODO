Stuff that still needs some love:

* Make 64 bit integers work reliably.  Simly using Perl's IVs doesn't seem to
do it since they are typedef'd to long here.  Currently, NVs are used.  They
provide enough room but are the wrong type really.

* Make GStreamer::Buffer / GStreamer::Data more robust.  Find out if enough of
the related macros are bound.

* Figure out whether to bind the stuff in GStreamer::Query and in
GStreamer::Format as function or as class static methods.  Also reconsider the
way GStreamer::Structure::to_string and ::from_string,
GStreamer::Caps::to_string and ::from_string, and Gst::Parse::launch are bound.

* Wrap missing API.  Many macros are not bound and need to be either exported
or worked around.  Missing xsubs are mostly marked with FIXMEs.
GStreamer::Error probably needs more accessors.  Completely or nearly
completely unbound headers include:
  - gstatomic.h
  - gstcpu.h
  - gstevent.h
  - gstfilter.h
  - gstinterface.h
  - gstmemchunk.h
  - gstpadlist.h
  - gstprobe.h
  - gstsystemclock.h
  - gsttag.h
  - gsttaginterface.h
  - gsttrace.h
  - gsttrashstack.h
  - gsturi.h
  - gstvalue.h
  - gstxml.h

* Figure out how to handle documentation generation for plugins.
