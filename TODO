Stuff that still needs some love:

* Make GStreamer::Buffer more robust.  Find out if enough of the related macros
are bound.

* Wrap missing API.  Many macros are not bound and need to be either exported
or worked around.  Missing xsubs are mostly marked with FIXMEs.  Completely or
nearly completely unbound headers include:
  - gstfilter.h
  - gstinterface.h
  - gstsegment.h
  - gsttask.h
  - gsttrace.h
  - gsttypefind.h
  - gsturi.h
  - gsturitype.h
  - gstutils.h
  - gstvalue.h
  - gstxml.h

* Figure out how to handle documentation generation for plugins.
