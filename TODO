Stuff that still needs some love:

* Make GStreamer::Buffer / GStreamer::Data more robust.  Find out if enough of
the related macros are bound.

* Figure out whether to bind the stuff in GStreamer::Query and in
GStreamer::Format as function or as class static methods.  Also reconsider the
way GStreamer::Structure::to_string and ::from_string,
GStreamer::Caps::to_string and ::from_string, and GStreamer::Parse::launch are
bound.

* Wrap missing API.  Many macros are not bound and need to be either exported
or worked around.  Missing xsubs are mostly marked with FIXMEs.
GStreamer::Error probably needs more accessors.  Completely or nearly
completely unbound headers include:
  - gstatomic.h
  - gstcpu.h
  - gstevent.h
  - gstfilter.h
  - gstinterface.h
  - gstmemchunk.h
  - gstpadlist.h
  - gstprobe.h
  - gstsystemclock.h
  - gsttrace.h
  - gsttrashstack.h
  - gsturi.h
  - gstvalue.h
  - gstxml.h

* Figure out how to handle documentation generation for plugins.
